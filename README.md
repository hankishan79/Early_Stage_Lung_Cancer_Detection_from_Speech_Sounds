Early Stage Lung Cancer Detection from Speech Sounds in Natural Environments

Overview
This repository contains code and data for a study that investigates the potential of speech sounds as biomarkers for the early detection of lung cancer. The study utilizes natural recordings of speech, advanced signal processing techniques, and a novel machine learning model, the GAT-ftCL model, to achieve a high accuracy rate of 90.94% in detecting lung cancer.

Research Highlights
High Accuracy: The study achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 90.94% in detecting lung cancer using speech biomarkers. This accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of speech analysis techniques in identifying early-stage lung cancer.

Detection of Stage 1 Lung Cancer: Notably, the model achieves an accuracy rate of 92.83% in discerning stage 1 cases of lung cancer. This finding underscores the potential of speech biomarkers as a non-invasive method for early detection, particularly in the crucial early stages of the disease.

Pioneering Approach: This study represents a pioneering approach to non-invasive screening for lung cancer. By leveraging speech signals as biomarkers, the research opens up new frontiers in the field of cancer detection, offering a promising avenue for early diagnosis and intervention.
